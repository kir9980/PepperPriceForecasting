# AGRI PRICE PREDICTOR - SPICES PRICE PREDICTION - PepperPriceForecasting
Black pepper is one of the most widely traded spices globally, with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil leading its production. Due to its extensive use in culinary and medicinal applications, black pepper holds significant economic value in domestic and international markets. However, price volatility caused by supply chain disruptions, seasonal variations, and quality differences makes accurate price forecasting crucial for farmers, traders, and exporters.
This study explores deep learning-based time series forecasting techniques for black pepper price prediction. While LSTM models have been widely used for commodity price forecasting, they face challenges related to data limitations, price fluctuations, and complex temporal dependencies. Recent advancements, including transfer learning, seasonality handling, and ensemble learning, have been explored to enhance prediction accuracy. Among the various models tested, GRU outperforms others by effectively capturing sequential patterns and delivering more accurate price forecasts.
The implementation is carried out in Python, utilizing multiple machine learning and deep learning models. Technical analysis indicators are also incorporated into the forecasting models, recognizing their practical significance despite limited statistical justification. The study compares different forecasting approaches, evaluates their performance, and identifies the most effective model for predicting black pepper prices, ultimately aiding market participants in better decision-making.
